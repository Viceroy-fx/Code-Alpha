ChatBot is a class, but in many ways, it can indeed perform actions similar to a function. When you create an instance of a class (an object), 
you're essentially setting up a lot of functionalities that can be called upon.

In this case, ChatBot("anas's chatbot", read_only=False, logic_adapters=["chatterbot.logic.BestMatch"]) is initializing the ChatBot object with specific parameters. 
This initialization process often involves running some internal code, similar to how a function executes. Once the object is created, you can call various methods on it to perform different actions, like:

response = bot.get_response("Hello")
print(response)

Here, get_response() is a method (a function defined within a class) that the ChatBot object can execute.

#!This list is special because when it will be passed (.train(the_answers)), the method will consider the first element to be the question and element that succeeds it to be the answer.
#!This means that the list will be even in its range, because we want to pass a question and get answers for all of them.

To make the bot more conversational, what we will do is that we will use other classes ppeople have already made, the classes which take our chatbot as their object.
those classes when we will use them on chatbot, with their methods... our chatbot can become way way way more conversational. We are doing this because we cannot use the
listTrainer class for holding coversations because we will be needing bigger lists... and we dont have time to make those biggers lists. .train(list) can only work so far to an extent. 
its best used when you are making a chatbot that is not conversation but more specific, ideally being used in a website or business in which it can only answers specific 
amount of questions in the list.. 

So functions are like performing only one task but a class is type of a whole domain or a huge number of blocks of codes and each blocks of code can be called upon with their
methods. (different functions that can be called upon and be used anywhere inside it). So like if something is inside a class (object), many different functions can be performed
